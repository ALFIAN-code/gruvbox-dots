This is a personal dotfile of mine that helps me when reinstalling my system and don't have much time to set up everything manually. I can use this.

Disclaimer: This dotfile is a personal dotfile, so it may not fully work on your computer.
tested on endavour os (gnome)

This is my first dotfile, so there may be scripts that are not efficient.
